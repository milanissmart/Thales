      <h2>Who Was Thales‚ùîü§®</h2>
      <p>Thales was regarded as the first Greek philosopher. We believe that he was born at around 624‚Äì620 BCE and died around 548‚Äì545 BCE. Thales was successful in astronomy and Math. He made great progress in early geometry. Thales was always examining nature for patterns. If Thales wrote anything we did not find it, everything we learned from him was from other sources of writing by other people. Thales is now one of the Seven Sages of Greece, an early group of thinkers that are recognized for their talent of wisdom. </p>

      <h2>What Were His Accomplishments? üìí</h2>
      <p>Thales had many accomplishments. One of his best was probably that he was able to predict a solar eclipse. That must have been a huge thing back then, I mean being able to predict the future, I would never have thought that could even be possible. He also had great accomplishments in geometry. He was the creator of the Thales's theorem. Also known as the intercept theorem or Basic Proportionality Theorem. The Thales's theorem states, ‚Äúif A, B, and C are distinct points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter, the angle ‚à† ABC is a right angle‚Äù (where did you get this). Thales was also able to find the height of the antient pyramids.  He first put a stick in the ground, then he measured the shadow of the stick. He made a ratio of the length og the stick to the shadow. Lastly, he used that ratio to find the length of the pyramid. Thales also had a theory that the Earth was flat. He thought that the Earth was a disk floating on water. </p>
